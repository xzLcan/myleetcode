* time complexity: `1 sec = 10^7 operations`
    * If the input size is 10^6, you can only do linear algorithms  
    * If the input size is 10^5, quasilinear (or better) algorithms  
    * If the input size is 3000, quadratic (or better)  
    * If the input size is 300, cubic (or better)  
    * If the input size is 13, `2^n`, `n^2`
